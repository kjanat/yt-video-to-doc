# TDD Demo Summary

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Enhanced Test Configuration
- Updated `vitest.config.ts` with:
  - Coverage thresholds (80% statements, 75% branches, 90% functions, 80% lines)
  - TDD-optimized watch mode with related file detection
  - Better error reporting for quick feedback

### 2. Created Comprehensive TDD Documentation
- Complete workflow guide at `docs/TDD_WORKFLOW.md`
- Red → Green → Refactor cycle explained
- Testing patterns and best practices
- Mocking and async testing examples

### 3. Implemented Real TDD Example
Created a new `TextPostProcessor` service using pure TDD:

1. **Started with failing tests** (Red phase)
   - Wrote 13 test cases before any implementation
   - Tests covered text cleaning, OCR fixes, confidence filtering, and text merging

2. **Implemented minimal code** (Green phase)
   - Fixed non-printable character removal while preserving newlines
   - Implemented OCR mistake corrections
   - Built logic for handling line breaks and paragraphs
   - Created confidence-based text filtering

3. **All tests passing** ✅
   - 13/13 tests passing
   - Ready for refactoring phase

## How to Use TDD Mode

### Start Watch Mode
```bash
pnpm test:watch
```

This will:
- Watch for file changes
- Re-run only related tests
- Provide instant feedback
- Show test results in real-time

### Run Tests with Coverage
```bash
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Interactive UI
```bash
pnpm test:ui
```

## Key TDD Benefits Demonstrated

1. **Confidence**: All code is tested from the start
2. **Design**: Tests drive better API design
3. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation
4. **Refactoring**: Safe to improve code with test coverage
5. **Focus**: Clear goals with each test case

## Next Steps

1. Use `pnpm test:watch` during development
2. Write tests BEFORE implementation
3. Keep tests fast and focused
4. Aim for coverage thresholds
5. Refactor only when tests are green

The `TextPostProcessor` is now ready to be integrated into the main video processing pipeline for cleaning up OCR output!
