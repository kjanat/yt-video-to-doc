# Build Error Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Jimp 1.6.0 Import Issues
- **Problem**: TypeScript couldn't find `Jimp.read()` method with standard imports
- **Solution**: Updated to use destructured imports: `import { Jimp, diff } from 'jimp'`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/services/ocr-service.ts`
  - `src/services/slide-detector.ts`

### 2. Jimp API Changes
- **Problem**: Several API methods changed in Jimp 1.6.0
- **Solutions**:
  - Changed `img.resize(width, height)` to `img.resize({ w: width, h: height })`
  - Changed `Jimp.diff()` to imported `diff()` function
  - Changed `writeAsync()` to `write()` with type assertion: `write(path as \`${string}.${string}\`)`

### 3. Setup Script Improvements
- **Added Node.js version check** to ensure Node 18+ is installed
- **Added build failure handling** with helpful error messages
- **Exit codes** properly set for CI/CD integration

## TypeScript Configuration
The project already had the correct TypeScript settings:
- `esModuleInterop: true`
- `allowSyntheticDefaultImports: true`

These were necessary for the Jimp 1.6.0 imports to work correctly.

## Build System
- Uses `pnpm` as package manager (v10.13.1)
- TypeScript compilation works correctly
- All dependencies resolve properly

## Testing the Fix
```bash
# Clean install and build
rm -rf node_modules
pnpm install
pnpm run build

# Or run the setup script
./setup.sh
```

The build now completes successfully without any TypeScript errors.
